=== Stock Analysis System Start Guide ===

System upgraded to APScheduler - simple and reliable!

🚀 Start the system:
-----------
Just start the FastAPI backend:

  cd stock-analysis-system
  uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

⚡️ New architecture benefits:
-----------
✓ No separate Celery worker/beat processes needed
✓ All tasks run inside the FastAPI process
✓ Code changes take effect immediately; no multi-process restarts
✓ Logs go straight to console for easy debugging
✓ Simpler, more reliable, easier to maintain

📊 The system will automatically:
-----------
- Check price alerts (every 1 minute, cumulative trigger_count mechanism)
  * Monitor all tracked stocks in real-time
  * Trigger alert after trigger_count reaches 5
  * Support cumulative change from baseline price

✨ Background tasks include:
-----------
- ✅ Price alert checks (every minute) - via APScheduler
- Stock data updates (extensible)
- News data updates (extensible)

📝 Viewing logs:
-----------
- All logs are printed to console
- See task execution in real time
- Includes detailed debug info (e.g., trigger_count changes)

🛑 Stop the system:
-----------
Press Ctrl+C to stop uvicorn; the scheduler shuts down gracefully

💡 Restart the system:
-----------
Just restart FastAPI; no other processes to manage:
  
  1. Ctrl+C to stop
  2. Run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 again

🔍 Monitoring:
-----------
On startup, console shows:
  - "✅ APScheduler started successfully"
  - Every minute: "🔥 Starting price alert check..."
  - Each alert's check result and trigger_count changes
